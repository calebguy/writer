# Writer Brand Guide

> "Write today, forever"

## Core Concept

Writer is an onchain writing platform where content is permanently stored on the blockchain. The brand captures the duality of **modern accessibility** and **timeless permanence**.

## Conceptual Foundation

### The Primitive-Digital Connection

- **Cave paintings** were humanity's first "write today, forever" - marks on stone that outlasted civilizations
- **Blockchain** is the digital equivalent - immutable, permanent, outlasting platforms
- **Writing on Writer** is a return to that primal impulse: *I was here. I thought this. Remember me.*

The Kokopelli carved into rock thousands of years ago still speaks to us today. That's what Writer offers users - the ability to leave marks that endure.

### Brand Tension

The brand lives in the tension between:

| Ancient | Modern |
|---------|--------|
| Cave paintings | Blockchain |
| Stone carvings | Digital interfaces |
| Primitive impulse | Contemporary tools |
| Forever | Today |

**"Today" leads. "Forever" resonates underneath.**

## Visual Direction

### Guiding Principle

The **form** is primitive. The **execution** is modern.

The permanence is implicit - it's in the symbol's DNA and the blockchain underneath, not in surface aesthetics. Users are writing *today*. The brand should feel inviting, alive, and accessible, with depth underneath.

### Primary Influences

- **Matisse cut-outs** - organic shapes, flowing forms, calm energy
- **Petroglyphs & cave art** - universal human symbols, timeless
- **Kokopelli** - the figure that outlasted its creators
- **Folk/primitive art** - simple, universal, enduring

*Less* Keith Haring energy (too frenetic), *more* Matisse contemplation.

### Reference Touchstones

For figure exploration:
- **Matisse "Blue Nude" series** - seated, contemplative organic forms
- **Petroglyphs** (Newspaper Rock, Southwest US) - grounded human symbols
- **Kokopelli** - the hunched, playing variant (not dancing)
- **Aboriginal rock art** - simple presence, universal marks
- **A.R. Penck** - primitive figures in modern context

### Visual Language

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Symbol** | Primitive human figure - the eternal, universal mark |
| **Execution** | Clean, flat, digital - the now |
| **Color** | Bold, contemporary palettes (green is a candidate, not locked) |
| **Typography** | Clean sans-serif - modern, readable |
| **Texture** | Minimal - subtle grain acceptable (charcoal quality), no faux-aged effects |
| **Line quality** | Hand-drawn feel, slightly organic, but rendered cleanly |
| **Feeling** | Fresh, alive, accessible - with conceptual depth underneath |

### What to Avoid

- Overly "techy" or cold aesthetics
- Faux-vintage, distressed, or artificially aged treatments
- Hyper-energetic, chaotic compositions (dancing, celebrating)
- Overly literal blockchain/crypto imagery (chains, blocks, coins)
- Complexity that obscures the human element
- Figures depicting explicit actions (writing, holding tools)
- Heavy, collapsed, overly serious compositions

## The Figure

The core brand symbol is an **abstracted human figure**. This figure represents:

- The writer (the human behind the words)
- The universal impulse to record and be remembered
- Connection to humanity's oldest form of permanent expression
- Life, movement, expression

### Figure Energy: The Duality

The figure must embody both sides of Writer's identity:

| Ancient/Introspective | Modern/Inviting |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Writing on rock | The platform today |
| Permanence, weight | Lightness, ease |
| Contemplative | Approachable |
| Grounded | Has life, breath |
| "I will remain" | "Come, it's easy" |

**The figure should feel like a deep breath - not a meditation, not a celebration.**

It sits in the middle: grounded but light, planted but not heavy, still but with breath in it. Like someone sitting comfortably, at ease, present.

### Figure Pose Principles

**Seek:**
- Grounded, wide stance (suggests permanence)
- Relaxed, soft arms (suggests ease and invitation)
- Subtle asymmetry (suggests life without action)
- Presence without depicting a specific action
- A symbol that *is*, not one that *does*

**Avoid:**
- Celebratory poses (arms up, dancing, jumping)
- Overly closed/collapsed poses (too heavy, too serious)
- Literal actions (writing, marking, holding objects)
- Symmetrical rigidity (feels robotic)
- Frenetic energy (too Haring, not enough Matisse)

### Figure Form

The figure should feel:
- **Timeless** - could be ancient or contemporary
- **Human** - warm, not robotic or geometric
- **Grounded but light** - planted, present, but not heavy
- **Universal** - simple enough to be understood across cultures
- **Organic** - Matisse blob quality, soft rounded edges, hand-drawn feel

### Figure as Symbol

The figure is a **hieroglyph** - evocative, not literal.

Hieroglyphs and petroglyphs work because they suggest presence without depicting a specific moment. The Writer figure should say:

> "I am here. I exist."

Not:

> "I am doing this specific thing."

The meaning (writing, permanence, expression) comes from context and concept - not from showing the figure literally writing.

## Brand Personality

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Permanent** | Confident, enduring, trustworthy |
| **Human** | Warm, personal, not corporate |
| **Accessible** | Simple, inviting, not intimidating |
| **Thoughtful** | Considered, intentional, meaningful |
| **Modern** | Clean, current, forward-looking |

## Voice & Tone

- Clear and direct
- Warm but not overly casual
- Confident without being boastful
- Inviting complexity to feel simple

## Progress & Open Questions

### Resolved
- **Brand concept** - "Write today, forever" - primitive/digital duality
- **Figure direction** - Grounded but light, present but inviting, hieroglyphic symbol
- **Style influences** - Matisse cut-outs, petroglyphs, organic blob forms
- **Energy** - Middle ground between introspective and celebratory
- **Execution** - Modern/clean rendering of primitive forms

### In Progress
- **Figure pose** - Exploring variations that balance groundedness with lightness
- **Primary color** - Green is liked but not locked; open to exploration

### To Resolve
- **Final figure** - Lock specific form/pose
- **Typography** - Specific typeface selection
- **Figure scaling** - How it works as icon, logo, pattern
- **Logo lockup** - Figure + wordmark relationship
- **Color palette** - Primary, secondary, system colors
- **Pattern usage** - How multiple figures work together
