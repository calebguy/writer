# Writer Brand Guide

> "Write today, forever"

## Core Concept

Writer is an onchain writing platform where content is permanently stored on the blockchain. The brand captures the duality of **modern accessibility** and **timeless permanence**.

## Conceptual Foundation

### The Primitive-Digital Connection

- **Cave paintings** were humanity's first "write today, forever" - marks on stone that outlasted civilizations
- **Blockchain** is the digital equivalent - immutable, permanent, outlasting platforms
- **Writing on Writer** is a return to that primal impulse: *I was here. I thought this. Remember me.*

The Kokopelli carved into rock thousands of years ago still speaks to us today. That's what Writer offers users - the ability to leave marks that endure.

### Brand Tension

The brand lives in the tension between:

| Ancient | Modern |
|---------|--------|
| Cave paintings | Blockchain |
| Stone carvings | Digital interfaces |
| Primitive impulse | Contemporary tools |
| Forever | Today |

**"Today" leads. "Forever" resonates underneath.**

## Visual Direction

### Guiding Principle

The **form** is primitive. The **execution** is modern.

The permanence is implicit - it's in the symbol's DNA and the blockchain underneath, not in surface aesthetics. Users are writing *today*. The brand should feel inviting, alive, and accessible, with depth underneath.

### Primary Influences

- **Matisse cut-outs** - organic shapes, flowing forms, calm energy
- **Petroglyphs & cave art** - universal human symbols, timeless
- **Kokopelli** - the figure that outlasted its creators
- **Folk/primitive art** - simple, universal, enduring

*Less* Keith Haring energy (too frenetic), *more* Matisse contemplation.

### Reference Touchstones

Primary influences for the figure:
- **Ancient votive figures** - Etruscan, Nuragic, and Sardinian bronze artifacts
- **Volcanic stone carvings** - weathered basalt and pumice sculptures
- **Matisse cut-outs** - organic blob forms, soft curves
- **Petroglyphs** (Newspaper Rock, Southwest US) - universal human symbols
- **Neolithic figurines** - simple, abstracted human forms

### Visual Language

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Symbol** | Star/X shaped humanoid - arms up, legs wide, "permanent but free" |
| **Primary execution** | Clean, flat, solid fill - for UI and functional use |
| **Expressive execution** | Volcanic stone texture - for marketing and emotional moments |
| **Color** | Bold, contemporary palettes (green is a candidate, not locked) |
| **Typography** | Clean sans-serif - modern, readable |
| **Form quality** | Organic blob limbs, soft curves, no sharp angles |
| **Feeling** | Grounded yet open, ancient yet inviting, permanent but free |

### What to Avoid

**Visual:**
- Overly "techy" or cold aesthetics
- Faux-vintage, distressed, or artificially aged treatments
- Overly literal blockchain/crypto imagery (chains, blocks, coins)
- Sharp angles, geometric rigidity

**Figure-specific:**
- Dancing, jumping, or celebrating poses
- Thin stick-figure limbs (must be thick organic blobs)
- Facial features, fingers, or toes
- Asymmetrical or dynamic action poses
- Figures doing explicit actions (writing, holding objects)
- Deviating from the star/X form (arms must angle up, legs must spread wide)

## The Figure

The core brand symbol is an **abstracted human figure** - a primitive humanoid forming a star or X shape. It represents:

- The writer (the human behind the words)
- The universal impulse to record and be remembered
- Connection to humanity's oldest form of permanent expression
- **"Permanent but free"** - rooted below, open above

### Figure Energy: The Duality

The figure embodies both sides of Writer's identity:

| Permanent | Free |
|-----------|------|
| Wide stance, rooted | Arms reaching up and outward |
| Grounded, stable | Open, expansive |
| "I'm not going anywhere" | "I'm open to everything" |
| Ancient artifact quality | Welcoming, alive |

**The figure feels like greeting the sunrise - grounded confidence with open arms.**

### The Final Form

#### Overall Shape
A symmetrical humanoid figure forming a **five-pointed star or X shape**. Standing upright with arms angled upward at approximately 45 degrees and legs spread wide at approximately 45 degrees. The figure radiates outward from a central torso mass.

#### Proportions
- **Head**: Oval/rounded, sits directly on torso (no distinct neck), approximately 1/5 of total height
- **Torso**: Compact central mass where all limbs connect, organic pinch at connection points
- **Arms**: Angled up and outward at ~45°, thick organic tubes that taper at torso and bulge at hands, rounded paddle-like ends
- **Legs**: Spread wide at ~45° angle, same organic tube quality, feet are rounded bulbs, slightly thicker than arms
- **Overall**: Five appendages (head + 2 arms + 2 legs) radiating from center

      /   \
     /     \
    🦶      🦶     ← legs (lower points, angled out 45°)
```

#### Form Qualities
- **Organic blob limbs** - thick tubes, not stick-thin
- **Bulbous ends** - hands and feet are rounded paddles, no fingers or toes
- **Soft connections** - limbs taper where they meet torso
- **No facial features** - simple oval head
- **Symmetrical** - bilateral symmetry, balanced

### Texture

The figure has two versions:

#### Primary (Flat)
- Solid flat fill, no texture
- Clean vector, infinitely scalable
- Used for: favicon, nav logo, app icon, UI elements

#### Expressive (Textured)
- Volcanic stone texture - rough, porous, granular like pumice or basalt
- Ancient artifact quality - weathered, hand-carved feeling
- Matte, non-reflective surface
- Used for: marketing, social media, print, merchandise

### Figure as Symbol

The figure is a **hieroglyph** - evocative, not literal.

> "I am here. I exist."

The wide stance says permanence. The open arms say freedom. Together: **permanent but free**.

### What to Avoid in Figure

- Dancing or celebrating poses
- Thin stick-figure limbs
- Sharp angles or geometric rigidity
- Facial features or expressions
- Fingers, toes, or detailed anatomy
- Asymmetrical or dynamic poses
- Literal actions (writing, holding objects)
